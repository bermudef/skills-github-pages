Today marks the beginning of my coding journey blog! After weeks of learning Python and working through tutorials, I finally decided to document my progress and share what I'm learning.

## Why Start a Blog?

As a beginning developer, I've realized that writing about what I learn helps me:
- Solidify my understanding of new concepts
- Track my progress over time
- Connect with other learners
- Build a portfolio of my work

## Setting Up GitHub Pages

Getting this blog running was easier than I expected! Here's what I did:

1. **Created a repository** on GitHub for my site
2. **Configured Jekyll** with the Minima theme
3. **Customized _config.yml** with my personal information
4. **Wrote my first post** (this one!)

The hardest part was deciding what to write about first.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to share:
- Python learning notes and tutorials
- Web scraping experiments with Beautiful Soup
- Coding challenges and solutions
- Mistakes I make and how I fix them

## First Lesson Learned

Starting is better than waiting for perfection. This blog isn't perfect, but it's mine, and it's a start.

Thanks for reading my first post! If you're also learning to code, feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/felipebermudez).
